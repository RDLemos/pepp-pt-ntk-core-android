Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing

(PEPP-PT) makes it possible to interrupt new chains of SARS-CoV-2
transmission rapidly and effectively by informing potentially exposed
people. We are a large and inclusive European team. We provide
standards, technology, and services to countries and developers.
We embrace a fully privacy-preserving approach. We build on well-tested,

fully implemented proximity measurement and scalable backend service.
We enable tracing of infection chains across national borders.
